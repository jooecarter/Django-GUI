# Django GUI

After many hours navigating the command line interface (CMD) to set up Django projects, dealing with numerous issues, and often running commands from incorrect directories, I decided to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application. 

This GUI aims to streamline the process of setting up and deploying Django applications, eliminating common frustrations and errors. It provides a more user-friendly approach, allowing developers to manage their projects more efficiently and with fewer headaches. By simplifying tasks that typically require extensive command-line interactions, this application enhances productivity and reduces the potential for mistakes during project configuration and deployment.

Changes will be made frequently to provide more advanced, user-friendly features.

* INSTALLATION *
Please make sure that the latest version of Python is installed and a path is added to environmental variables on your machine before running the DjangoGUI.
